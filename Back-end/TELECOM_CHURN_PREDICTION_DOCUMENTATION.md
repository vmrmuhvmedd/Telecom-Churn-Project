## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Customer churn, defined as the cessation of customer relationships with a service provider, represents one of the most significant challenges facing the telecommunications industry. Industry reports indicate that the cost of acquiring new customers is five to twenty-five times higher than retaining existing ones (Reichheld & Sasser, 1990). In the highly competitive telecom sector, where customer switching costs are relatively low, understanding and predicting churn patterns becomes paramount for business sustainability and growth.

The traditional approach to churn management relies heavily on reactive strategies, where interventions occur only after customers have initiated the churning process. This reactive paradigm often results in delayed responses and reduced effectiveness of retention efforts. The implementation of predictive analytics and proactive churn management strategies has emerged as a critical differentiator for telecom companies seeking to maintain competitive advantage.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This research addresses the following primary objectives:

1. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop and deploy machine learning models capable of accurately predicting customer churn based on historical behavioral and demographic data.
2. **Real-time Analytics**: Create an interactive dashboard providing comprehensive insights into customer behavior patterns and churn risk factors.
3. **System Integration**: Establish a robust, scalable architecture that seamlessly integrates machine learning capabilities with web-based user interfaces.
4. **Operational Deployment**: Demonstrate the practical implementation of churn prediction systems in production environments.

### 1.3 Significance and Contributions

The development of this Churn Prediction Dashboard contributes to both academic research and practical industry applications by:

- Demonstrating the feasibility of real-time machine learning integration in production web applications

    # Ensure feature alignment
    for col in feature_names:
        if col not in df_encoded.columns:
            df_encoded[col] = 0
    
    df_encoded = df_encoded[feature_names]
    
    # Generate prediction and probability
    prob = model.predict_proba(df_encoded)[0][1]
    threshold = 0.355
    prediction = int(prob > threshold)
    
    return {
